# sleep_deprivation-HSI


* `SPARK_fMRI_HDI.m` performs the following analysis: 

         STEP 1. xxx
         STEP 2. xxx
         STEP 3. xxx
         STEP 4. xxx

* Other scripts to implement the remainings of the SPARK analysis, such as the parallel implementation of the sparse dictionary learning, spatial K-means clustering, background noise removal, and k-hubness estimation, can be found and adapted from [SPARK](https://github.com/multifunkim/spark-matlab).   

* `SPARK_HSI.m` computes the hierarchical segregation index (HSI).
